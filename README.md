## Chapter 1 - Shape & Colours
### Looped HSB
- A full-windowed canvas displaying the HSB Colour Model.

### Interactive Looped HSB
- Replaced the static canvas to follow the mouse curser.
- In result, interactivity changes the scale of the HSB Colour Model.

### Radial Fan (HSB Variant)
- A medium-canvas displaying the HSB Colour Model in a radial fan pattern.
- Uses `DEGREES` instead of `RADIANS`.
- 2 versions: Static (commented out) and interactive.

### Basic Translations
- A refresher on the basics of `translate()`, `push()` and `pop()`.

### Interactive Colour Tool
- An interactive canvas that demonstrates the HSB Colour Model.
- Includes a colour wheel with rotating hues, Hue Display, Saturation Display and Brightness Display.
- Interaction consist of moving the mouse cursor from left to right to demonstrate HSB.
- Designed in a simplistic manner for User Experience (UX).
- An exercise to test on what we have learned so far within this chapter (i.e. color-shape). 

### Colour Interpolation (Tweening)
- Experimenting with the P5.js function `lerpColor()` to display interpolation.

## Chapter 2 - Shape & Patterns
### Playing with Shapes and Patterns
- A pattern of lines isolated within a circular perimeter.
- Practicing the use of `TWO_PI` - based on P5.js docs.

### Trigonometry
- Practicing the use of Inverse Tan (i.e. Tan-^1)
- P5.js version = atan()
- Each object rotates individually depending on where the mouse cursor is. 

### Trigonometry (Iteration 2)
- Using the previous project above, each circles has smaller circles in them to display the `atan2()` function.
- Calculating the scale value is also demonstrated within this exercise. 

### Controlled-Randomised Pattern
- A pattern of controlled-randomised objects demonstrating ordered-random.
- Includes a bespoke animation loop that displays a "pulsating" colour effect.
- Courtesy to Eoan O'Dea for helping out with the "pulsating" colour animation loop.  

### Controlled-Randomised Pattern (Iteration 2)
- A continuation of the project above but with a different pattern.
- Includes basic pseudo-randomised squares and circles with Andy Warhol inspired design as well as a "subwoofer" inspired effect.

### Patterned Wrapping Paper 
- A very challenging assignment that includes some of the student's understanding of pixel manipulation however, not fully. 
- Added an array to allow the manipulation of pixels within the individual gridded images.
- Added an alternative for 2D array to allow the change of different colours per image. 
- Canvas Dimensions: 1754 x 2481 
- This project requires a live server to successfully run (e.g. [Live Server for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)). Otherwise, the images will not display.
